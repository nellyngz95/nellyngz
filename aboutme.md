Hi, I’m Nelly Garcia — a research scientist specializing in sound synthesis and the optimization of sound design. I explore how sound aesthetics and audience perception intersect to create memorable and emotionally resonant auditory experiences.

My passion lies in storytelling through sound — whether in cinema, TV, radio, or immersive media. I believe that the most powerful stories are remembered not just by their words, but by the sounds that define them. From subtle textures to bold sonic signatures, I use advanced techniques to craft soundscapes.

For me, it’s simple: great stories stick with you because of the words and the sounds. I want to create those unforgettable audio moments — the kind people remember, and talk about, long after they hear them.
